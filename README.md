# 🎉 dotFun Language

dotFun is a modern, flexible programming language designed with a strong focus on readability, expressiveness, and developer ergonomics. It embraces a pragmatic approach to software development, aiming to empower programmers to write clean, maintainable code with minimal boilerplate.

## ✨ Philosophy

At its core, DotFun prioritizes clarity and simplicity without sacrificing power or flexibility. It encourages developers to write code that is both intuitive and explicit, promoting best practices while allowing for creative freedom.

Key principles include:

- **Optional Syntax:** DotFun reduces unnecessary noise by making certain syntax elements optional, allowing code to flow naturally while maintaining precision where it matters.

- **Robust Object-Oriented Design:** The language fully supports object-oriented programming, with comprehensive constructs for classes, interfaces, enums, and structs, coupled with clear access control modifiers to model complex systems effectively.

- **Expressive Control Flow:** DotFun offers expressive control structures that facilitate readable and maintainable logic, making complex decision-making and iteration straightforward.

- **Unified Error Handling:** Inspired by modern language design, DotFun provides a consistent and clear error handling mechanism that integrates seamlessly with the flow of the program.

- **Strong Typing with Flexibility:** It balances static type safety with optional type annotations to cater to both explicitness and rapid development.

- **Extensibility and Modularity:** DotFun encourages modular code organization and aims for easy extensibility, making it well-suited for a wide range of applications from scripting to full-scale software development.

## 📈 Goals

dotFun aims to be both a practical tool for developers and an interesting platform for language design exploration. It focuses on making code enjoyable to write and easy to understand, empowering developers to express ideas directly and effectively.
